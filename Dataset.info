About the Dataset
In order to reduce the number of owned cars, the city of Tel Aviv launched a shared-car project, called AutoTel.
 Users of the service are able to reserve a car using a mobile app, and pay for it by the minute. 
 The project that was launched in October 2017 attracted over 7500 users, with more than 50% of them using the service at least once a week.
